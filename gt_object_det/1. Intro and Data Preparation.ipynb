    "## Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Phew! That felt like a lot of work, but a lot of the steps were hacks for our example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To find raw image data for our targets (boots and cats), we mapped our class names to the public OpenImages dataset and used their existing annotations to find relevant images.\n",
    "* To get a decent data volume without spending forever annotating in the workshop, we merged our Ground Truth annotation results with other augmentation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The useful points to remember are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* SageMaker Ground Truth (and as we'll see later, many of the built-in algorithms as well) uses **augmented manifests** to define annotated image datasets.\n",
    "* These manifests are just plain text [JSON Lines](http://jsonlines.org/) files that we can also edit in our own code to do whatever we like from importing/exporting annotations, to stitching together datasets as we did here.\n",
    "* Once the input manifest is prepared, it only takes a few clicks to define workforce teams and annotation jobs in SageMaker Ground Truth: Which supports other built-in and even custom annotation workflows for a variety of data types and tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we didn't use it here due to the dataset size, the [automated labelling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-automated-labeling.html) feature can drastically cut annotation costs and time on bigger data-sets for the tasks where it's supported (including object detection).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ground Truth supports validation workflows (typically much faster for humans) as well as labelling; which can be combined with automated labelling in light of the importance of good quality ground truth input to effective machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the follow-on notebooks, we'll use the composite training and validation datasets we created here to fit a variety of models and compare their performance. Let's move on to notebook 2(a)!"
