    "## About the Algorithm: YOLOv3\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed with reference to benchmarks on the project [website](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) and detailed in the [original paper](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Redmon_You_Only_Look_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) (Redmon et al, 2016), YOLO (\"You Only Look Once\") is another highly successful object detection algorithm alongside SSD as implemented in the SageMaker built-in algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both YOLO and SSD are \"one-stage detectors\", in contrast to previous R-CNN group methods which separately 1) propose and then 2) validate and adjust bounding boxes. Tackling the region proposal and classification/validation problems together gives these architectures significant speed benefits at comparable accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas SSD creates convolutional \"feature maps\" at different scales and learns to predict the offset of \"anchor boxes\" relative to those; YOLO in parallel computes \"class probabilities\" on subdivided grid squares of the image, and bounding box coordinates for likely objects - before correlating the two together.\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice comparison of the methods is presented [here](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/12/27/object-detection-part-4.html). Recent advances in YOLO (v2 and v3 releases) have led to it achieving better accuracy than SSD at comparable model sizes / speeds in some benchmarks, as shown in the below graph reproduced from the [GluonCV Model Zoo](https://gluon-cv.mxnet.io/model_zoo/detection.html)\n",

    "\n",
    "From a script complexity perspective, the simplest approach would be to choose `s3_data_type=\"S3Prefix\"` and estimator `input_mode=\"File\"` (the defaults): in which case the matching files in S3 are simply downloaded to the container before the training job starts, and our training job code should load those to an in-memory dataset. This is the approach taken in the [official SageMaker MXNet MNIST example](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/sagemaker-python-sdk/mxnet_mnist).\n",
    "\n",
    "File mode is easy to use, but for jobs with large data sets we can cut container disk size and job startup time requirements by using **Pipe Mode** instead. Instead of downloading the full dataset to your container before starting work, Pipe Mode sets up a **stream** - which looks like a file on disk but only supports sequential access. Because the stream can't seek back to the start, SageMaker creates a new stream for each epoch - for example `/opt/ml/input/train/train_0` for the first.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'd still like SageMaker to shuffle our data, so how do we handle a use case like this where we need *both* the image file and its corresponding annotations to be useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "One solution could be to provide two separate channels for the images and the annotations (like the SageMaker built-in Image Classification algorithm when training with [\"Image Format\"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/image-classification.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "A more feature-rich approach is the **AugmentedManifestFile** data type we used in the previous example. With this method, SageMaker steps through the manifest file and produces *multiple records in the stream for each row*: One for each (potentially filtered) attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute names ending `-ref` (like our `source-ref`) are resolved to the raw contents of the S3 file URI they point to. Other attributes are passed through as plain text (i.e. JSON)... So in our case, the file stream in the container receives alternating records of image data and JSON annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might imagine (and will see in the training script file), using Pipe Mode and AugmentedManifestFile means we have to translate this stream into the (probably different) format our models expect. This is easier for some libraries than others (for e.g. there's a [PipeModeDataset](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-tensorflow-extensions#sagemaker-pipe-mode) class built-in for TensorFlow users), and Gluon makes things particularly difficult by implementing random access as a standard interface of base dataset classes: making them unsuitable for streaming in general.\n",

For the built-in algorithms, SageMaker already knows what metrics are defined... But for a custom algorithm (since we could be `print()`ing whatever we like), we need to supply the definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**No explicit \"training_image\"...:** As discussed in the last notebook, we only needed to use the generic `Estimator` SDK and supply a Docker image URI for the built-in SSD algorithm because there wasn't a specific SDK class for it. MXNet [has one](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_mxnet.html) though, so the image URI is implicit. You can find more details about the (actually separate) SageMaker MXNet [training](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-mxnet-container) and [inference](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-mxnet-serving-container) containers in GitHub, as well as the shared [cross-framework base](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-containers) they inherit from.\n",
    "\n",
    "**...But need to specify framework versions:** Because multiple incompatible versions of Python (2 vs 3), or the ML framework (e.g. TensorFlow 1 vs 2) may be supported at a given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom hyperparameters:** As with metrics, it's entirely up to us what hyperparameters we want to support and how: So any hyperparameters are fully custom to our code in the [src](src) folder. There's also a little inconsistency between frameworks and built-in algorithms about whether hyperparameters are passed in as a `hyperparameters` argument in the constructor or with a separate `set_hyperparameters()` function, but otherwise the process is the same."
